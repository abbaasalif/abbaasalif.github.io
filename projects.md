# My Projects

Here are some of the projects I have worked on. Each project's description and README are included below.
# NP‑Complete Solver LLM

[Visit on GitHub](https://github.com/abbaasalif/NP-complete-solver-LLM)

This project is a Flask‑based web application that leverages GPT‑4 and OR‑Tools to solve NP‑complete problems. The application supports several problems—including the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), 0/1 Knapsack Problem, and Graph Coloring Problem—by classifying natural language descriptions provided by the user and then iteratively refining GPT‑4’s solution using feedback from OR‑Tools until convergence.

## Features

- **Natural Language Problem Classification:**  
  Enter a plain language description of your NP‑complete problem. GPT‑4 classifies it (e.g., TSP, KNAPSACK, GRAPH_COLORING) and directs you to the appropriate form.

- **Detailed Input Forms:**  
  Based on the classification, you can provide structured details (cities and a distance matrix for TSP, items and capacity for Knapsack, or an adjacency matrix and number of colors for Graph Coloring).

- **Iterative Feedback Loop:**  
  For each problem, if GPT‑4’s solution does not match the solver’s solution, the system feeds back the solver’s output to GPT‑4 until the responses converge (or a maximum number of iterations is reached).

- **Rich Result Display:**  
  View both GPT‑4’s solution and the OR‑Tools/CP‑SAT solution along with iteration counts and additional details (such as selected items with weights and values for the knapsack problem).

I have a scheduling problem that can be modeled as a graph coloring problem.

I need to assign colors (numeric indices) to each class so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, using exactly 3 colors. Please help me find a valid coloring solution.
```

#### Detailed Input

- **Adjacency Matrix (one row per line, comma-separated):**

  1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1
  0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1
  1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0
  ```

- **Number of Colors:**

  ```
  3
  ```

### How to Use These Scenarios

- **For TSP:**  
  Paste the natural language description into the home page’s description field. Once the problem is classified as TSP, use the detailed input (cities and the 20×20 distance matrix) in the TSP form to solve the problem.

- **For Knapsack:**  
  Use the provided natural language description on the home page to have the system classify it as a knapsack problem. Then, in the knapsack form, paste the items string and enter the capacity (50).

- **For Graph Coloring:**  
  Enter the natural language description to have the system classify it as a graph coloring problem. In the graph coloring form, paste the provided adjacency matrix and enter the number of colors (3).
