   I am Arbbaz Alif Abdul Shafeeq. As a Master’s student in Business Analytics and Artificial Intelligence at UT Dallas, I bring a strong foundation in data-driven decision-making, bolstered by hands-on experience in e-surveillance, predictive modeling, and AI-powered analytics. With a background in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, I’ve successfully bridged technical expertise with real-world applications—whether improving machine learning accuracy through smart camera integration or building an NLP-based injury intelligence dashboard that reduced manual analysis time by 70%. A 3rd-place winner in both the DataWhiz Hackathon and TripAI Case Competition, I’m passionate about using AI to solve business challenges. Currently serving as a Student Ambassador for the Business Analytics Leadership Council, I actively promote student-industry collaboration and professional development.
